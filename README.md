### **Update Log**:  
**Current Version**: **1.2**  
**Info**:  
_Most recent update was adding a new temporary toggle to remove the hunt in the home page. I also added a check for updates feature in the menu for 1.1 (which hardly lasted) which you can click at any time.
Recently added an update that removes the most recent "The Hunt" update to the homepage. Wasn't a big fix so I won't count it as an update._
